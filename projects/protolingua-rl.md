# ProtoLingua RL

**Can AI agents invent their own language?**

## Summary
A multi-agent reinforcement learning environment where agents must cooperate to solve puzzles but share no pre-defined communication channel.

## Why
To study the emergence of syntax and grounding in artificial agents.

## What & How
- **Environment**: Custom 2D Gridworld (Gymnasium).
- **Algorithm**: PPO with shared reward.
- **Outcome**: Agents developed a primitive signaling system using movement patterns.

## Status
Paused. Planning to migrate to a more complex 3D environment.
