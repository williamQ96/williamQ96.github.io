# Updates

Quick notes on what I’m building, researching, or experimenting with lately.
Short, direct, and always evolving.

## December 2025

> 🚗💨 **Car Rush Update:** The indie game "Car Rush" is pushing hard for an alpha launch by the end of the year! 🏁🎮

> 🐸🚀 **Meme-Based Engineering:** We propose "Meme-Based Engineering" (MBE) as a development trend for the current era. MBE is a software development paradigm driven by the lifecycle of internet trends, using AI as the primary creative tool. It adopts ultra-short cycles, micro-scale teams, low maintenance costs, and pursues immediate market value realization.
