# Updates

Quick notes on what I’m building, researching, or experimenting with lately.
Short, direct, and always evolving.

## December 2025

MBE is a software development paradigm driven by the lifecycle of internet trends, using AI as the primary creative tool. It adopts ultra-short cycles, micro-scale teams, low maintenance costs, and pursues immediate market value realization.
