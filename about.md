# About Me

![Profile Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

I am a hybrid researcher/engineer with a passion for building systems that bridge the gap between AI and human creativity.

## Philosophy
> "Code is not just functionality; it's a medium for expression."

My work focuses on:
- **Scalable ML Systems**: Building robust infrastructure for large language models.
- **Game Intelligence**: Using AI to create more immersive and responsive game worlds.
- **Open Science**: Documenting failures and successes transparently.

## Motivation
I built this site to escape the "perfect resume" trap. Here, you'll find polished projects alongside rough experiments and work-in-progress logs.
